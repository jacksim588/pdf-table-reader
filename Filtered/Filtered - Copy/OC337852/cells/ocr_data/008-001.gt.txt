Since our last SECR report in 2019/20 where we replaced one of two main chiller units, in
2020/21 we have replaced the second chiller unit. This is expected to yield further efficiency
benefit and therefore energy and emission savings alongside the first unit.

Going forward into the 2021/22 financial year, a plan has been created to change all existing
lighting to high efficiency LED luminaires.
