JJ FOOD HOLDING CO LTD

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021

Carbon reporting and the environment

The group supports the drive for sustainable business and reducing the impact on the environment and has developed a
sustainability policy. The group's vision on sustainability is “to conduct business responsibly, to the benefit of all stakeholders
and with reference to relevant Sustainable Development Goals as set by the United Nations”

The group is required to make disclosures under Companies (Directors' Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and
Carbon Report) Regulations 2018:

2021 2020
Energy use in Greenhouse gas__ Energy use in Greenhouse gas
kWh emissions in kWh emissions in
kgCO2e kgCO2e
Electricity 8,549,600 2,016,568 7,091,661 1,812,629
Gas 485,192 89,212 438,058 80,537
Transport 12,707,077 3,056,942 10,203,681 2,578,164

GHG intensity per £100 of sales is 2.332kgCO2e (2020: 1.951kgCO2e). The most significant reason for this increase was due
to the additional transport mileage resulting from the pivot to the direct to customer next-day delivery service, as necessitated by
the pandemic.

GHG emissions are from operationally controlled activities in accordance with WRI/WBCSD Reporting Protocols (Revised
edition) using 2020 BEIS conversion factors

The principal action taken for increasing the group's energy efficiency during the year was to complete the purchase of a new
vehicle fleet to meet LEZ requirements and this has continued to be implemented during the current year. It is to early quantify
the resulting energy saving.

The group continued replacing lighting and equipment during maintenance with LED lighting and energy efficient equipment and
all staff are encouraged to conserve energy wherever possible.
