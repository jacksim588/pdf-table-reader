We have followed the 2019 HM Government Environmental Reporting Guidelines. We have also used the GHG
Reporting Protocol — Corporate Standard and have used the 2020 UK Government's Conversion Factors for Company

Reporting.

lntensity measurement

The chosen intensity measurement ratio is total gross emissions in metric tonnes COQ2e per sq. ft, the recommended

ratio for the sector.

Measures taken to improve energy efficiency

We are working with an energy consultant to conduct a forensic analysis of the site energy consumption for each store
in order to highlight the higher energy users for primary focus. We have continued with our programme of installing
LED lighting across stores and have drastically reduced mileage travelled by utilising teleconferencing to communicate

with teams.

Statement of disclosure to auditor

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the
necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit
information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information
