The combined scope one and two carbon emissions for the period was recorded at 1,093 TCO2e. This is a reduction of
18.22% over the previous period, with the largest proportion of reduction coming from scope one sources.

The specific carbon consumption (SCC) for the period is calculated at 32.98 kgCO2e/E of sales floor area (SFA) m3, a
reduction of 18.23% over the previous period.

The energy consumed in the period is 4,814,806 kWh, a reduction of 23.54% over the previous period. The bulk of the saving
has come through a reduction in gas consumption.

It has been a difficult year for the retail sector with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in addition to the exit of the
European Union, impacting on supply chains. A large focus on efficiency and reductions will be made when trading patterns

return to normal.
