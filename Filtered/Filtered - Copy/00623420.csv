60 days from end of month
All agreements are put in place and signed in accordance with the supplier's terms and conditions before any purchase is
made. This is checked and authorised by a Senior member of the team.

Trade creditor days per the financial statements is 82 days

Whilst this is the figure of trade creditor days per the financial statements, this does not give a true indication of the actual
creditor days because 3 of the company’s main suppliers have set direct debit payments for the first working day of the
month in reflection of the payment terms of NHSBSA.

The true creditor days figure is 33 days, as reported to HMRC in the payment practices report of May to October 2021.
